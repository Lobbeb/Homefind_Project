# üè† HomeFinder
> For our project, we would like to develop a new website that shifts the focus of property search away from geographical features and onto the immediate surroundings of a potential new home.
## ‚ú® Abstract 
Homefinder is a website that shifts the focus of property search away from geographical features and onto the immediate surroundings of a potential new home. The purpose of this project is to refine and tailor the apartment search experience to the users‚Äô needs. Users should be able to filter their search based on self-selected criteria to obtain the best results for them. The website should have the capability to find all available listings that meet the user‚Äôs chosen filters. The results will be displayed on a map, and users can save these results to their favorites for future reference. The advantage of such a search is that users won‚Äôt have to conduct their own research to discover what‚Äôs nearby the apartment. With the mapbased search, it‚Äôs easy for users to see the Points of Interest in the vicinity of the location. With enough input data, the website can suggest the best home for the user, making the apartment search more enjoyable and time-saving.
